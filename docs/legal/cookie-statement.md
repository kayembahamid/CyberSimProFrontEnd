# CyberSim Pro Cookie Statement

_Last updated: October 1, 2025_

## 1. What Are Cookies?
Cookies are small text files stored on your device. We use them to operate the website, remember preferences, and—if you consent—measure product interest.

## 2. Types of Cookies We Use
- **Essential cookies**: Required for security (session protection, rate limiting). Always active.
- **Analytics cookies** (optional): Segment and Google Tag Manager collect aggregated usage data to improve marketing campaigns.

## 3. Managing Preferences
- When you visit the site, a banner asks for consent. Declining keeps analytics disabled.
- You can change your decision by clearing the `cybersim-consent-v1` entry in local storage or using browser settings.
- You can opt out of Google Analytics via [tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## 4. Third-Party Cookies
Enabling analytics may allow cookies from Segment, Google, and Calendly (if you book a meeting). These providers have their own privacy policies.

## 5. Updates
We may update this Cookie Statement as our tooling changes. Review periodically to stay informed.
