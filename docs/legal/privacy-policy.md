_Last updated: October 1, 2025_

## 1. Scope
This Privacy Policy explains how CyberSim Pro (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects personal information when you browse our marketing site, request a demo, or interact with our Model Context Protocol (MCP) services.

## 2. Information We Collect
- **Lead form data**: name, work email, company, timeline, notes.
- **Device data**: IP address, browser details captured for security purposes.
- **Product analytics** (optional): when consented, we use Segment/GTM to track engagement (page views, clicks).
- **Support communications**: messages sent to support@cybersimpro.com.
We do not collect sensitive personal data, consumer financial information, or end-user telemetry unless separately contracted as part of a service agreement.

## 3. How We Use Information
- Respond to demo requests and provision pilots.
- Share pricing collateral and compliance evidence.
- Improve product messaging and measure campaign performance (only with consent).
- Maintain security, investigate abuse, and comply with legal requests.

## 4. Legal Basis
We process personal data based on legitimate interest (B2B sales outreach), consent (optional analytics), and contractual necessity (pilot provisioning). For EU/UK visitors, you may withdraw consent at any time by using the cookie banner or contacting us.

## 5. Sharing & Transfers
- CRM/Marketing Automation (HubSpot/Salesforce) for lead management.
- Email service providers (SendGrid/Outlook) for communications.
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS, Vercel) hosting static assets and serverless APIs.
We do not sell personal information. Cross-border transfers rely on SCCs or equivalent safeguards.

## 6. Data Retention
Lead data is retained for up to 24 months unless you request deletion earlier. Audit logs relating to security incidents may be kept longer if required by law or contractual obligations.

## 7. Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may request access, correction, deletion, or restriction of your personal data. Contact privacy@cybersimpro.com to exercise these rights.

## 8. Cookies & Tracking
Essential cookies maintain session security. Optional analytics cookies only load after consent (see Cookie Statement). You can manage preferences via the banner or browser settings.

## 9. Security
We implement encryption in transit, rate limiting, audit logging, and regular penetration testing. MCP customers may enable additional safeguards (SCIM, dual-control approvals, sealed audit trails).

## 10. Children’s Privacy
CyberSim Pro is intended for corporate use. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 16.
