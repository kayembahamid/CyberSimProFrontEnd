# CyberSim Pro Workflow Deep Dives

## Purple Team Enablement
- **Problem signal**: exercise planning takes weeks, red/blue teams lack a common timeline, and executives rarely see actionable output.
- **How CyberSim Pro addresses it**: scenario wizard builds MCP-native adversary stories, automates command-chain logging, tracks facilitator notes, and produces replayable evidence bundles.
- **Artifacts delivered**:
  - Reachability heatmap for each adversary technique
  - Facilitator kit with objectives, roles, comms templates
  - Executive wrap-up deck with ROI metrics and recommended control actions
- **Metrics**:
  - 4× faster tabletop preparation (4 days → 1 day)
  - 95% fewer false positives escalated to SOC during exercises
  - 3 tangible recommendations per scenario accepted by leadership
- **CTA**: [Book a scenario review](#contact) or download the compliance matrix.

## SOC Readiness
- **Problem signal**: triage teams fight noisy alerts, and SOC managers struggle to prove coverage to leadership.
- **How CyberSim Pro addresses it**: telemetry replay, automated control feeds into SIEM/SOAR, real-time gap analysis across detections.
- **Artifacts delivered**:
  - MITRE ATT&CK coverage report with reachable/exploitable findings
  - Notebooks for detection engineers to tune/validate new rules
  - Weekly SOC performance digest (MTTD/MTTR trends)
- **Metrics**:
  - 60% reduction in time spent validating detections
  - 80% coverage of high-risk techniques within first month
  - 50% faster MTTD on high-fidelity alerts during pilots
- **CTA**: [Download the SOC readiness workbook](assets/docs/cybersim-product-onepager.pdf) once final.

## Resilience Reporting
- **Problem signal**: executive stakeholders lack consolidated insight for board/regulator meetings, manual slide prep drains capacity.
- **How CyberSim Pro addresses it**: automated board-ready briefings, compliance matrix exports, regulator-ready audit seals.
- **Artifacts delivered**:
  - Board narrative (top risks, mitigations, investment asks)
  - Regulator bundle with attestation letters and evidence hashes
  - Program roadmap with prioritized control improvements
- **Metrics**:
  - 4× faster regulator response turnaround
  - 2× increase in control adoption across engineering teams
  - 100% of quarterly board meetings include MCP evidence deck
